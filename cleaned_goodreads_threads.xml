    <title>Julien added 'Giovanni’s Room'</title>
    <updated>2025-06-05T00:24:43-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “Giovanni’s Room” by James Baldwin
⭐️ Rated: 4/5

📝 "Giovanni’s Room is a sentimental love story, sometimes bordering on melodrama, but it’s Baldwin’s writing that makes it the classic it is. His flow is effortless, and his descriptions of emotions, places, and people are so precise, you truly feel like you’re in the room. The plot may not be the most remarkable, but that only highlights the strength of Baldwin’s craft. This is a novel carried entirely by voice and atmosphere, and it works beautifully. —— Giovanni’s Room est un roman sentimental,..."

    <title>Julien added 'The Case of the Blonde Bonanza'</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T01:16:11-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “The Case of the Blonde Bonanza” by Erle Stanley Gardner
⭐️ Rated: 3/5

📝 "The Case of the Blonde Bonanza is a slightly offbeat Perry Mason mystery, where the actual crime shows up rather late in the narrative and is resolved rather quickly. But the build-up to the murder is clever and refreshingly different from the usual formula. Set away from Los Angeles, it gives both Perry, and the reader, a welcome break from the recurring courtroom clashes with Hamilton Burger and the gruff presence of Lt. Tragg. A pleasant and inventive entry in the series. ⸻ The Case of the Bl..."

    <title>Julien added 'Evil Under the Sun'</title>
    <updated>2025-05-30T07:49:27-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “Evil Under the Sun” by Agatha Christie
⭐️ Rated: 4/5

📝 "Evil Under the Sun is a Poirot novel written at a time when Christie clearly still cared deeply for the character, and it shows. Present throughout the entire story, the Belgian detective draws on la nature des choses to guide his investigation, and Christie takes her time to develop each character in the way she does best. It’s a win-win: for the writer, who’s clearly enjoying her craft, and for the reader, who’s treated to a classic closed-circle mystery set on a small island. The final revela..."
