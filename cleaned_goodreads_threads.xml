    <content type="text">📚 “The Making of Casablanca: Bogart, Bergman, and World War II” by Aljean Harmetz
⭐️ Rated: 4/5
📝 "How do you write a making-of book about one of the greatest films of all time when, famously, nothing chaotic ever happened on set? You write its biography instead. Aljean Harmetz has crafted a captivating and thoroughly researched work, not just about the making of Casablanca, but about the people who made it happen. From the producer to the set designer, the sound recordist to the costume team, and of course the director and actors, every layer is explored in depth. The book is filled with ins..."

    <title>Julien added 'Malayland'</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T17:44:32-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “Malayland” by Dina Zaman
⭐️ Rated: 2/5
📝 "Malayland is an interesting book in theory, but in practice, it often feels like a long reading list disguised as an argument. At just 147 pages, it should be a concise, engaging exploration of Malaysia’s cultural and political identity, but instead, it’s packed with over a hundred footnotes, constantly pointing the reader to other books and studies rather than developing its own ideas. Dina Zaman is clearly well-read, and she makes sure you know it. Throughout the book, there’s a strong sense t..."

    <updated>2025-09-11T05:59:02-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “Eye of the Needle” by Ken Follett
⭐️ Rated: 3/5
📝 "Eye of the Needle takes a while to get going, about halfway through, the suspense really kicks in, but once it does, it’s an effective and gripping spy thriller. The interwoven narratives slowly build tension, leading to a frantic and rewarding conclusion. its structure and pacing ultimately deliver a solid Second World War-era tale of espionage and survival. —— Eye of the Needle met du temps à vraiment démarrer,ce n’est qu’à mi-parcours que le suspense prend de l’ampleur, mais une fois lancé, c..."

    <updated>2025-07-31T07:24:06-07:00</updated>
    <content type="text">📚 “The Case of the Ice-cold Hands” by Erle Stanley Gardner
⭐️ Rated: 3/5
📝 "The Case of the Ice-Cold Hands is a later entry in the Perry Mason series, but Gardner still brings the punch. What really keeps the series appealing is the dynamic between the three main characters, Mason, Della, and their occasionally screwball relationship, with Paul Drake playing the perfect third wheel. The crime in this one is fairly standard, and the plot follows familiar beats, but an unexpected twist during a rare grand jury appearance makes it all worthwhile. —— Un tome tardif dans la..."
